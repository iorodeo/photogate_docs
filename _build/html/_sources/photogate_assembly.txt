Using a small Philips blade screwdriver. insert and secure wires into the RJ11 breakout board as shown in the image below. 

* Phototransistor wires first (white, green) followed by emitter LED wires (black, red). 

Using some of the left-over black wire from the LED component, form a small u-shaped loop and place the ends into the last two terminal blocks. This is for the auto-detect function.
